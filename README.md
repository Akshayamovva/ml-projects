Global Temperature and GHG Emissions Analysis

This project involves building predictive regression models to study the relationship between global temperature changes and GHG emissions using a large dataset of 8.6M+ records. The data preprocessing included mean imputation based on the past five years to handle missing values. Multiple regression models were trained and tuned, including Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost, using Pipelines and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. All models were evaluated using R², MSE, and RMSE to ensure fair and accurate performance comparison. The Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest performance with an R² score of 0.873, demonstrating strong predictive capability. The project leverages tools and libraries such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost, showcasing the application of machine learning techniques for climate data analysis.

Vehicle Insurance Claim Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will file a vehicle insurance claim using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains 381,109 records and 12 features, with the target variable indicating whether a claim was made. The data preprocessing phase involved handling missing values through mean and mode imputation, removing outliers, encoding categorical features, and applying SMOTE to balance the dataset. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns between customer demographics, vehicle details, and claim probability. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with SelectKBest (Chi² test) used for feature selection. Model pipelines, ColumnTransformer, and RandomizedSearchCV were utilized for efficient preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning. Model performance was evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, where the Random Forest Classifier achieved the best accuracy of 0.89, demonstrating strong predictive power. The project showcases how machine learning can enhance risk assessment and decision-making in the vehicle insurance industry by identifying key factors influencing claim likelihood.

Multiclass Sentiment Classification Using Merged Market and Emotion Datasets

This project involved multiclass sentiment classification by combining insights from two datasets: Fear & Greed Index and Historical Transaction Data. Both datasets were cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical columns. The datasets were then merged based on common attributes to create a unified view for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to extract key insights such as transaction trends, emotional sentiment distribution, and market behavior patterns. A Random Forest Classifier was applied for multiclass sentiment prediction, achieving 100% accuracy on the test set, which highlighted highly distinguishable sentiment patterns in the data. The project utilized Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Label Encoding, MinMaxScaler, and Random Forest Classifier to deliver a robust sentiment analysis solution.
